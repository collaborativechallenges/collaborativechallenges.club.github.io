                <p id="mcetoc_1e8pjseu50"><strong>We are creating an exhaustive report of every blogging platform that is in active development.</strong></p>

<h2 id="mcetoc_1e8prl9b20">Help needed</h2>
<p>This guide lines and below template are not final. If you have </p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e8pjtvg21">Why?</h2>
<p>There are so many options for peole who want to have their own blogging, portfolio or landing site. Choosing the right plaftorm for our particular needs can be so exhausting that many people give up.</p>
<p>Every platform was created out of necessity. Which means each and every one of those platforms are in use. And as users of those platforms, we believe we should report our experiences for other people to make better informed decisions for their next site.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e8pk67p43">How?</h2>
<p class="msg msg--warning">We appreciate every contribution but we would be happier if you submit a report for a platform that is not mentioned in the report page.</p>
<p>After creating a report according to below template, mail it to <a href="mailto:collaborativechallenges.club@protonmail.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">collaborativechallenges.club@protonmail.com</a>. See the example to have better idea on what goes where.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e8pkc9iu4">When?</h2>
<p>Funny you ask that :D</p>
<p>It started the moment you read <strong>When?</strong> title and it will continue till there is no such thing as personal blog/portfolio or landing page.</p>
